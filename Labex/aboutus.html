      <h1 class="meetour2">MEET OUR GROWERS.</h1>
      <p class= "meetour">Pistachios are grown by a community of farmers, some on family-owned farms, many in the second or third generation of farming. Their livelihoods depend on Mother Nature and their ability to work with her. They’re involved in their communities and work diligently toward a sustainable future in farming. With a constant eye on the weather and another on the crop, these folks all have one thing in common—they love what they do.

        Check in occasionally as we add growers to our LARISSA Pistachio Growers photo album, and welcome to the farm!</p>
